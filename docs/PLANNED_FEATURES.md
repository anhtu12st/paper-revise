## Enhanced Differentiable Memory (ðŸ”¨ In Progress)

### Overview
Advanced memory system with content-based addressing and multi-head attention, designed to improve multi-hop reasoning capabilities.

### Planned Components

#### MemoryController Class
**Status:** ðŸ”¨ Partially implemented in `memory_modules.py`

**Planned Features:**
- Content-based memory addressing using cosine similarity
- Multi-head read/write attention (1-8 heads)
- Configurable attention sharpening (temperature control)
- Memory usage tracking for optimal slot allocation
- Temporal link matrix for relationship tracking

**Configuration Parameters:**
```python
model = MemXLNetForQA(
    base_model=base_model,
    mem_token_count=32,
    use_differentiable_memory=True,  # Enable differentiable memory
    num_memory_heads=4,               # Multi-head attention
    memory_sharpness=2.0,             # Attention temperature
    enable_usage_tracking=True,       # Track slot usage
    enable_temporal_links=True,       # Track relationships
    memory_slots=64                   # Number of memory slots
)
```

**Current Implementation Status:**
- âœ… Basic interface defined in `MemXLNetForQA`
- âœ… Configuration parameters accepted
- ðŸš§ Full `MemoryController` implementation pending
- ðŸš§ Multi-head attention mechanism pending
- ðŸš§ Usage tracking system pending

## Multi-Hop Reasoning Utilities (ðŸš§ Planned)

### HopTracker
**Status:** ðŸš§ Planned

**Purpose:** Track reasoning chains across multiple hops in complex questions.

**Planned Features:**
- Automatic hop detection and recording
- Confidence scoring per hop
- Attention flow visualization
- Bridge entity identification

**Planned API:**
```python
from memxlnet.utils.multihop_utils import HopTracker

tracker = HopTracker(track_attention=True, track_content=True)
tracker.record_hop(memory_info, question_part="...", extracted_info="...")
chain = tracker.get_reasoning_chain(question, answer)
```

### MemoryVisualizer
**Status:** ðŸš§ Planned

**Purpose:** Visualize memory state and attention patterns.

**Planned Features:**
- Memory state heatmaps
- Usage pattern visualization
- Temporal link graphs
- Attention flow diagrams

**Planned API:**
```python
from memxlnet.utils.multihop_utils import MemoryVisualizer

visualizer = MemoryVisualizer()
fig = visualizer.plot_memory_heatmap(memory_state, title="Memory State")
fig = visualizer.plot_usage_pattern(usage, temporal_links)
fig = visualizer.plot_attention_flow(attention_weights)
```

## Additional Planned Features

### 1. Adaptive Memory Allocation (ðŸš§ Planned)
Dynamic memory slot allocation based on question complexity and document length.

### 2. Memory Compression (ðŸš§ Planned)
Compress less-important memory slots to maintain long-term context.

### 3. Cross-Document Memory (ðŸš§ Planned)
Share memory states across related documents for better knowledge integration.

### 4. Memory Persistence (ðŸš§ Planned)
Save and restore memory states between training sessions for continual learning.

## Contributing

If you're interested in implementing any of these features:

1. **Check current status** in this document
2. **Review existing code** in `src/memxlnet/models/memory_modules.py`
3. **Open an issue** to discuss implementation approach
4. **Submit a PR** with tests and documentation

---

## Notes for Developers

### Current Fallback Behavior
The codebase includes graceful fallbacks when enhanced memory features are not available:

```python
# In memxlnet_qa.py
try:
    from .memory_modules import MemoryController
    DIFFERENTIABLE_MEMORY_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    DIFFERENTIABLE_MEMORY_AVAILABLE = False

# Later in __init__
if use_differentiable_memory and DIFFERENTIABLE_MEMORY_AVAILABLE:
    self.memory_controller = MemoryController(...)
elif use_differentiable_memory:
    warnings.warn("Differentiable memory requested but not available...")
```

This ensures backward compatibility and allows gradual implementation.

### Testing Strategy
When implementing planned features:
1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests with existing pipeline
3. Regression tests to ensure backward compatibility
4. Performance benchmarks vs token-based memory
