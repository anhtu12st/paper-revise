**Configuration Parameters:**
```python
model = MemXLNetForQA(
    base_model=base_model,
    mem_token_count=32,

    memory_slots=64                   # Number of memory slots
)
```

- âœ… `DifferentiableMemory` class with all features
- âœ… Multi-head attention mechanism working
- âœ… Usage tracking system functional

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_memory_modules.py` (26/26 passing)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_differentiable_memory_training.py` (13/13 passing)
- Example: `examples/train_with_differentiable_memory.py`

## Multi-Hop Reasoning Utilities (ðŸš§ Planned)

### HopTracker
**Status:** ðŸš§ Planned

**Purpose:** Track reasoning chains across multiple hops in complex questions.

**Planned Features:**
- Automatic hop detection and recording
- Confidence scoring per hop
- Attention flow visualization
- Bridge entity identification

**Planned API:**
```python
from memxlnet.utils.multihop_utils import HopTracker

tracker = HopTracker(track_attention=True, track_content=True)
tracker.record_hop(memory_info, question_part="...", extracted_info="...")
chain = tracker.get_reasoning_chain(question, answer)
```

### MemoryVisualizer
**Status:** ðŸš§ Planned

**Purpose:** Visualize memory state and attention patterns.

**Planned Features:**
- Memory state heatmaps
- Usage pattern visualization
- Temporal link graphs
- Attention flow diagrams

**Planned API:**
```python
from memxlnet.utils.multihop_utils import MemoryVisualizer

visualizer = MemoryVisualizer()
fig = visualizer.plot_memory_heatmap(memory_state, title="Memory State")
fig = visualizer.plot_usage_pattern(usage, temporal_links)
fig = visualizer.plot_attention_flow(attention_weights)
```

## Additional Planned Features

### 1. Adaptive Memory Allocation (ðŸš§ Planned)
Dynamic memory slot allocation based on question complexity and document length.

### 2. Memory Compression (ðŸš§ Planned)
Compress less-important memory slots to maintain long-term context.

### 3. Cross-Document Memory (ðŸš§ Planned)
Share memory states across related documents for better knowledge integration.

### 4. Memory Persistence (ðŸš§ Planned)
Save and restore memory states between training sessions for continual learning.

## Contributing

If you're interested in implementing any of these features:

1. **Check current status** in this document
2. **Review existing code** in `src/memxlnet/models/memory_modules.py`
3. **Open an issue** to discuss implementation approach
4. **Submit a PR** with tests and documentation

---

## Notes for Developers

### Current Fallback Behavior
The codebase includes graceful fallbacks when enhanced memory features are not available:

```python
# In memxlnet_qa.py
try:
    from .memory_modules import MemoryController
    DIFFERENTIABLE_MEMORY_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    DIFFERENTIABLE_MEMORY_AVAILABLE = False

# Later in __init__
if use_differentiable_memory and DIFFERENTIABLE_MEMORY_AVAILABLE:
    self.memory_controller = MemoryController(...)
elif use_differentiable_memory:
    warnings.warn("Differentiable memory requested but not available...")
```

This ensures backward compatibility and allows gradual implementation.

### Testing Strategy
When implementing planned features:
1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests with existing pipeline
3. Regression tests to ensure backward compatibility
4. Performance benchmarks vs token-based memory

## Recent Completion: Phase 1 (January 2025)

Phase 1 of the differentiable memory system is now complete! This includes:

- **Full MemoryController implementation** with content-based addressing
- **Multi-head attention** supporting 1-8 heads
- **Usage tracking** for memory slot optimization
- **Temporal links** for relationship tracking
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 39 tests (26 unit + 13 integration)
- **Example script** demonstrating all features
- **Complete integration** with training pipeline

### Getting Started with Differentiable Memory

```python
from memxlnet.models import MemXLNetForQA
from transformers import XLNetForQuestionAnsweringSimple

# Load base model
base_model = XLNetForQuestionAnsweringSimple.from_pretrained("xlnet-base-cased")

# Create model with differentiable memory
model = MemXLNetForQA(
    base_model=base_model,
    mem_token_count=16,
    use_differentiable_memory=True,
    num_memory_heads=4,
    memory_sharpness=2.0,
    enable_usage_tracking=True,
    enable_temporal_links=True,
    memory_slots=32,
)

# Use in training or inference as normal
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Access memory information
if "memory_info" in outputs:
    memory_info = outputs["memory_info"]
    print(f"Read weights: {memory_info['read_weights'].shape}")
    print(f"Memory usage: {memory_info['usage']}")
```
