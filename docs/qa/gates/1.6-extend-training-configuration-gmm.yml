# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  PASS gate decision based on:

  1. All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
  2. Comprehensive test suite with 27 tests, all passing
  3. Code quality excellent - clean design, full documentation, proper validation
  4. All NFRs satisfied (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
  5. No test coverage gaps - all ACs mapped to validating tests
  6. Standards compliance verified (ruff linter clean, proper docstrings)
  7. Backward compatibility maintained and tested
  8. No blocking issues or concerns identified

  Minor future considerations noted but not blocking for production release.
