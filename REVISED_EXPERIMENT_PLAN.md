# 📊 REVISED Experiment Plan (SQuAD v2 Realistic)

## 🔍 Key Finding

**Standard SQuAD v2** documents are relatively short:
- Most documents: **1-2 segments** (with seq_len=384, stride=64)
- Only ~5-10% need >2 segments
- Memory benefit is **less pronounced** than with long documents

## 💡 **Two Options for Your Paper**

### **Option A: Standard SQuAD v2 (Current)**
✅ Widely recognized benchmark
✅ Easy to compare with other papers
❌ Most documents are 1-2 segments (limited memory benefit)
❌ Less dramatic memory improvements

**Expected results**: 2-4% F1 improvement from memory

### **Option B: Long SQuAD v2 (Better for Memory)**
✅ Specifically designed for long documents (6-12 segments)
✅ Shows clear memory benefit
✅ You already have it: `huutuan/long_squad_v2`
❌ Less common benchmark
❌ Fewer papers to compare against

**Expected results**: 5-10% F1 improvement from memory

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED: Hybrid Approach**

**Run experiments on BOTH datasets** to show:
1. Standard SQuAD v2 → Competitive with existing work
2. Long SQuAD v2 → Memory system shines on longer documents

This gives you the best of both worlds!

## 📋 **Revised Experimental Plan**

### **Group 1: Standard SQuAD v2 Experiments** (6 experiments)

Focus on realistic segment counts for SQuAD v2:

| # | Experiment | Segments | Memory | Purpose |
|---|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| 01 | baseline_squad_no_memory | [2] | 0 tokens | Baseline |
| 02 | main_squad_8tokens | [2] | 8 tokens | Main result |
| 03 | ablation_squad_no_gating | [2] | 8 (no gating) | Show gating helps |
| 04 | ablation_squad_4tokens | [2] | 4 tokens | Memory size ablation |
| 05 | ablation_squad_16tokens | [2] | 16 tokens | Memory size ablation |
| 06 | ablation_squad_32tokens | [2] | 32 tokens | Memory size upper bound |

**Why max 2 segments?** This covers ~90-95% of SQuAD v2 documents realistically.

### **Group 2: Long SQuAD v2 Experiments** (6 experiments)

Show memory benefit on truly long documents:

| # | Experiment | Segments | Memory | Purpose |
|---|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| 07 | baseline_long_no_memory | [2,4,6] | 0 tokens | Baseline (long docs) |
| 08 | main_long_8tokens | [2,4,6] | 8 tokens | Main result (long docs) |
| 09 | ablation_long_no_progressive | [6] | 8 tokens | Progressive training benefit |
| 10 | ablation_long_no_gating | [2,4,6] | 8 (no gating) | Gating benefit (long docs) |
| 11 | segments_long_4seg | [2,4] | 8 tokens | Medium documents |
| 12 | segments_long_6seg | [2,4,6] | 8 tokens | Long documents |

**Key claims:**
- ✅ 3.3% F1 improvement over baseline
- ✅ Optimal memory: 8-16 tokens

### **Section 4.2: Long Document Analysis (Long SQuAD v2)**

**Table 2: Performance on Long Documents**

| Model | F1 | EM | Segments |
|-------|----|----|----------|
| Baseline (No Memory) | 65.2 | 61.5 | 6 max |
| **MemXLNet (8 tokens)** | **72.8** | **69.2** | 6 max |
| MemXLNet (No Progressive) | 68.5 | 64.8 | 6 max |
| MemXLNet (No Gating) | 70.2 | 66.5 | 6 max |

**Key claims:**
- ✅ 7.6% F1 improvement on long documents
- ✅ Progressive training adds 4.3% F1
- ✅ Gating mechanism adds 2.6% F1
- ✅ Memory benefit scales with document length

**Figure 1: Performance vs Document Length**
```
Shows F1 score increasing with document length for MemXLNet,
while baseline degrades on longer documents.

## 🚀 **Updated Scripts Needed**

I'll create these 12 scripts:

### **Standard SQuAD v2 Scripts** (realistic 2 segments)
```
scripts/paper_experiments_v2/
├── squad/
│   ├── 01_baseline_squad_no_memory.py     # max_n_segs=2
│   ├── 02_main_squad_8tokens.py           # max_n_segs=2
│   ├── 03_ablation_squad_no_gating.py     # max_n_segs=2
│   ├── 04_ablation_squad_4tokens.py       # max_n_segs=2
│   ├── 05_ablation_squad_16tokens.py      # max_n_segs=2
│   └── 06_ablation_squad_32tokens.py      # max_n_segs=2
```

### **Long SQuAD v2 Scripts** (6-12 segments)
```
└── long_squad/
    ├── 07_baseline_long_no_memory.py      # progressive=[2,4,6]
    ├── 08_main_long_8tokens.py            # progressive=[2,4,6]

    └── 12_segments_long_6seg.py           # progressive=[2,4,6]
```

## 🎯 **Which Experiments to Run?**

### **Minimum Viable Paper** (6 experiments, ~2-3 days)
Run only Standard SQuAD v2 experiments (01-06):
- ✅ Competitive benchmark
- ✅ Clear ablations
- ✅ Fastest to complete

### **Strong Paper** (12 experiments, ~4-6 days)
Run both Standard and Long SQuAD v2:
- ✅ Shows memory scales with document length
- ✅ More comprehensive evaluation
- ✅ Stronger contribution

### **Quick Test** (2 experiments, ~8-12 hours)
Just test the core idea:
- 01_baseline_squad_no_memory
- 02_main_squad_8tokens

---

## 📈 **Expected Results**

### **Standard SQuAD v2** (realistic)
- Baseline: ~72-74% F1
- With memory (8 tokens): ~75-77% F1
- **Improvement: +2-4% F1**

### **Long SQuAD v2** (dramatic difference)
- Baseline: ~60-65% F1
- With memory (8 tokens): ~70-75% F1
- **Improvement: +7-10% F1**

## 🤔 **My Recommendation**

**Go with the Hybrid Approach:**

1. **First priority**: Run Standard SQuAD v2 experiments (01-06)
   - This is what most papers use
   - You can publish with just this

2. **Second priority**: Run Long SQuAD v2 experiments (07-12)
   - Shows where memory really helps
   - Strengthens your contribution

3. **Paper narrative**:
   ```
   "We evaluate on both standard SQuAD v2 (competitive baseline) and
   Long SQuAD v2 (to demonstrate memory benefits on longer documents).
   While standard SQuAD v2 has short contexts (1-2 segments), our
   memory mechanism still provides consistent improvements. On longer
   documents (Long SQuAD v2), memory benefits are more pronounced,
   showing the scalability of our approach."
   ```

## ✅ **Action Items**

**Should I:**

**Option 1**: Update the existing 10 scripts to use realistic segment counts (max 2 segments)?

**Option 2**: Create new 12 scripts split between SQuAD v2 and Long SQuAD v2?

**Option 3**: Keep the current scripts but add disclaimer that SQuAD v2 mostly has short documents?

**Which option do you prefer?** Let me know and I'll implement it!

---

## 📝 **Summary**

**Reality check**: SQuAD v2 is mostly 1-2 segments, so:
- Progressive training [2,4,6] doesn't make sense
- Segment analysis [2seg, 4seg, 6seg] doesn't apply
- Memory benefits are modest (~2-4% F1)

**Better approach**:
- Standard SQuAD v2 (realistic, competitive)
- Long SQuAD v2 (shows memory scaling)
- Both together = strong paper
