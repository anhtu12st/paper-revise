# Evaluation Results

This directory contains evaluation result JSON files from model evaluation runs.

## File Naming Convention

- `fixed_evaluation_results.json` - Latest evaluation results
- `fixed_evaluation_results_FULL_stage_N_segs_M.json` - Results from stage N with M segments per document

## Note

Result files are git-ignored by default. Keep only important baseline results in version control.
